## 1. High-Level Summary (<= 150 words)

Smallholder farmers across Bangladesh are trapped in a fragile Boro–Fallow–Aman monoculture, depleting Barind tract groundwater by -1.48 cm/year and degrading soils during bare fallow months. **FieldShift 2026** is a rotation-first decision-support tool that bridges 25 years of NASA Earth observations directly to smallholder farmers. 

A farmer enters their field anywhere in Bangladesh and evaluates their existing rotation against three NASA-informed alternatives (Balanced, Water-Saving, Soil-Building) using exact mathematical optimization (PuLP MILP). Each strategy features a deterministic 5-item card detailing why it was chosen, scientific evidence from NASA GPM IMERG, POWER, GRACE, and SoilGrids, benefits versus baseline, data gaps, and risks. 

With plain-language popovers ("এর মানে কী?") and mandatory local SAAO verification notices, FieldShift empowers farmers to adapt crop rotations with scientific conservatism.

## 3. Project Details

### Why: The Smallholder Rotation Crisis in Bangladesh
In the drought-prone Barind Tract (Rajshahi, Bogura) and floodplains of Bangladesh, millions of smallholder farmers face severe ecological and financial risks. Pumping deep tubewell groundwater for dry-season Boro rice consumes unsustainable electrical energy and causes severe aquifer drawdown. Simultaneously, extended fallow periods leave topsoil exposed to rainstorm erosion, exhausting biological soil organic matter.

Traditional agrarian planting calendars cannot adapt to modern climate volatility. However, a single-season planting advisory is not enough: farmers require a comprehensive, multi-season **crop rotation strategy** that builds soil health, cuts water demand, and breaks pest cycles while safeguarding household cash income.

### What: A Rotation-First Decision Support Platform
FieldShift models an agronomic horizon of **6 distinct agricultural seasons across 2 years** (Rabi dry season, Kharif-1 pre-monsoon, Kharif-2 monsoon). 

1. **Existing Rotation Baseline:** The farmer registers their current practice (e.g. Boro–Fallow–Aman) in "My Farm". FieldShift models this baseline under identical agro-meteorological constraints.
2. **Three NASA-Informed Alternative Strategies:**
   - **Balanced Strategy:** Solves for a multi-objective trade-off between profit, water conservation, and soil health.
   - **Water-Saving Strategy:** Replaces heavy dry-season rice with low-water pulses and oilseeds, weighted by GRACE groundwater depletion rates.
   - **Soil-Building Strategy:** Mandates biological nitrogen-fixing (BNF) legumes and continuous living soil canopy, cutting synthetic urea costs.
3. **Deterministic 5-Item Strategy Assessment Card:**
   - *১. কেন এই প্রস্তাব? (Why Suggested):* Derived deterministically from objective components and binding farmer constraints.
   - *২. উপাত্তভিত্তিক প্রমাণ (Scientific Evidence):* Calibrated with NASA POWER 25-year climatology, GPM IMERG rainfall, GRACE water trends, and SoilGrids hydraulic properties.
   - *৩. বিদ্যমান অভ্যাসের তুলনায় সুবিধা (Benefits vs Baseline):* Clear delta in water saved (mm), BNF nitrogen fixed (+70 kg N/ha), soil organic carbon gain, bare days reduced, and net gross margin.
   - *৪. তথ্যের ঘাটতি (Information Gaps):* Discloses satellite resolution limitations ($0.5^\circ$ vs micro-drainage) and lack of local laboratory soil tests.
   - *৫. ঝুঁকি ও মাঠপর্যায়ে স্থানীয় যাচাইকরণ (Risks Needing Local Review):* Advises seed germination checks and field drainage inspections.
4. **Mandatory Extension Verification Notice:** Every strategy output concludes with:
   > *"এটি সিদ্ধান্তে সহায়তার জন্য; স্থানীয় কৃষি কর্মকর্তার (SAAO) সাথে যাচাই করুন।"*  
   > *(This is for decision support; please verify with your local Sub-Assistant Agriculture Officer).*
5. **Plain-Language Explanations ("এর মানে কী?"):** Interactive popovers translate technical agronomic terms into intuitive farmer language: evapotranspiration ($ET_0$), soil moisture anomalies, canopy greenness, heat stress thresholds, FAO-56 water balance, satellite versus ground measurements, reanalysis versus direct observation, and uncertainty bounds (P10–P90).
6. **Scenario Perturbation & 64-District Choropleth:** Interactive climate sliders allow farmers and extension officers to simulate rainfall ($\pm 20\%$) and temperature ($+0..+2^\circ\text{C}$) perturbations, observing real-time strategy resilience across all 64 districts.

### How: Honest Science & Discrepancy Disclosure
FieldShift does not invent data or gloss over scientific contradictions:
- **POWER vs. GPM IMERG Discrepancy:** While NASA POWER $0.5^\circ$ reanalysis suggested an earlier pre-monsoon onset in western Bangladesh (-21.5 days in Rajshahi, $p=0.0038$), high-resolution NASA GPM IMERG $0.1^\circ$ direct satellite precipitation does **not** confirm this shift ($p \ge 0.34$, median shift 0.0 days in Bogura). Both datasets confirm that the main monsoon Aman onset has remained stable ($p \ge 0.19$).
- FieldShift adheres to satellite-confirmed IMERG observations and prevents premature planting advisories.
